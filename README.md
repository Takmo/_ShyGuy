# _ShyGuy

These are the Max/MSP project files for my _ShyGuy project.

This project was constructed for PERF 318 during Fall 2017 at
Texas A&M University.

The `ActivityDetector` and `ObserverDetector` patches contain sections
written by Jeff Morris. All other components are freely released under
terms of the MIT software license.

_ShyGuy (the Max/MSP program, not the lovable figure in the hoodie) is a
computer-driven performer who, when left to his own accord, will happily
fabricate melodies in constantly varying (and often intermediate) musical keys.
He is fond of both major and minor pentatonic scales, and adjusts his colors
according to activities occurring within his environment. However, when
_ShyGuy discovers that he has an audience, he quickly quiets down until all
observers have disappeared or sufficiently disguised their surveillance.

This counter-interactive work uses randomness to drive many of its aspects,
which the listener can observe in the dominating melody, the gradually
shifting white noise, and slow transitions between keys, modes, and dynamic
values. Much of _ShyGuy is driven, or rather nullified, by the presence and
interaction of an audience. _ShyGuy seeks to disrupt the standard relationship
between performer and audience by asking the question: what if the performance
doesnâ€™t want to be seen?
